Thank you for downloading 800Craft, a custom Minecraft server based on fCraft.

Special thanks to fragmer, what a bro!


=== Installation (Windows) ====================================================

800Craft requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0. Your system may already have it
installed, and you can download it from microsoft.com

=== Installation (Linux, Unix, MacOS X) =======================================

800Craft requires Mono 2.10 (recommended). You can
download it from www.mono-project.org, or (on some Linux distributions) install
it through your package manager.

To be able to use graphical 800Craft components (ServerGUI and ConfigGUI) you
will also need GDI+ library (libgdiplus). Before starting 800Craft, make sure
that it has read/write permissions in the 800Craft directory.

To run ".exe" files with Mono, use the following syntax:
Mono 2.6.4: "mono SomeFile.exe"
Mono 2.8+:  "mono --gc=sgen SomeFile.exe"

If you're intending to run a public server that appears on minecraft.net's server list, 
you need to import https certificates to tell mono you trust them, this can be done by 
running mozroots --import --ask-remove as the 800Craft user on your system.

=== Initial Setup =============================================================

Before starting the server for the first time, run ConfigGUI.exe to choose
your server's name and settings.

You may need to add firewall exceptions for 800Craft applications (ConfigGUI,
ServerGUI, or ServerCLI, or ServerWinService) to allow incoming TCP connections
on the listening port. Default port is 25565.

If your server is behind a router, you may also need to set up port forwarding
on the same port. See www.port-forward.com for further guidance.

When you are ready to start the server, run ONE of the available server
front-ends (GUI, CLI, or WinService).

=== Troubleshooting ===========================================================

Server does not show up on minecraft.net list:
    Make sure that server is public. Open ConfigGUI, set Visibility: [Public]
        (or set <IsPublic> to true in config.xml).

"Could not connect to server: it's probably down":
    Make sure that you added firewall exception for 800Craft (if applicable),
    and forwarded the port on your router. If you are connecting from same
    computer that the server is working on, try connecting to:
    https://minecraft.net/classic/play?ip=127.0.0.1&port=____
        (fill in the blank with your server's port number)

"Could not verify player name":
    Verification problems occur when your 800Craft server cannot verify identity
    of connecting players. Here are some things that may cause or fix
    verification problems:
    1. If minecraft.net is offline or slow, wait for it to stabilize.
    2. If minecraft.net is working but you still cant verify name, log out then
        log back in.
    3. Try restarting your server. Wait a couple minutes before trying to
        connect to a newly-restarted server (to give your server time to
        synchronize with minecraft.net).
    4. If you (or your players) are using WoM client's "Resume" function, which
        uses cached verification information, use the proper log-in procedure
        in WoM. The "Resume" function only works as long as your IP does not
        change and as long as the server does not restart.
    5. If you are using WoM and connecting with a bookmark, make sure that the
        bookmarked address starts with "http://minecraft.net/..." and not
        "mc://...". Addresses in the form "mc://" are temporary, and will stop
        working whenever the server is restarted.

Other players cannot connect from the same LAN/network as me:
    Minecraft client has a lot of trouble working on LAN. You probably will not
    be able to connect via the public URL. There is a workaround:

    1. Check "Allow connections from LAN without verification" in ConfigGUI.
        (or set <AllowUnverifiedLAN> to true in config.xml).
    2. Find your local IP address.
        * In Windows XP+, go to Start -> type "cmd" to open a terminal ->
            type "ipconfig". The address you need is labeled "IPv4 Address"
            under "Local Area Connection".
        * In Unix/Linux, use "ifconfig" utility. 
   3. Connect to https://minecraft.net/classic/play?ip=____&port=____
        (fill in the blanks with your server's IP address and port number)

I get errors when my PlayerDB / Worlds / Config tries to save:

	Possible causes of this are as follows:

	1. Running 800Craft from a protected system directory (e.g. Windows or ProgramFiles folder) while using 	a non-administrative user account. In that case, 800Craft's data should go into AppData, ProgramData, 	or some directory owned by your user account.

	2. Accidentally running 800Craft from a temporary folder. If you downloaded 800Craft in a zip file, and 	tried to run it directly from the zip file, it'll end up being extracted and launched from a temporary 	folder. Instead, extract all files to a permanent location before running 800Craft.

	3. Launching two copies of 800Craft. UnauthorizedAccessException can happen when two processes try to 	write to the same file at the same time. In that case, don't run two instances of 800Craft from the 	same directory.

	4. Launching a sandboxed, freshly-downloaded copy of 800Craft. Open file properties, and see if there 	is a "Security" note indicating that the file came from the Internet, and an "Unblock" button next to 	it.

	5. Trying to write to a read-only file. Make sure none of 800Craft's files are marked as read-only (in 	files' properties).

	6. Trying to write to a read-only drive. Make sure you're not running 800Craft from a USB drive, 	CD/DVD, or a remote network share.

	7. Trying to treat a directory as a file (e.g. saving a file with an exact name as an existing 	directory). Unlikely as it is, make sure there's no directory named "PlayerDB.txt" in 800Craft's 	folders.

	8. If all else fails, try to run 800Craft as Administrator. UAC can sometimes get in the way even if 	you do everything right.



=== List of Files =============================================================

       ConfigGUI.exe - Graphical interface for editing your server's settings,
                       rank setup, and world list. Also includes a map coverter
                       and terrain generator. If you alter configuration while
                       the server is running, use /reloadconfig command to
                       apply the changes. Note that some changes (like changes
                       to the rank list and IRC configuration) require a full
                       server restart.
       ConfigCLI.exe - A simple command-line configuration tool.

       fCraft.dll - Core of the server, used by all other applications.
       fCraftGUI.dll - Provides shared functionality for Config and Server GUI.

       ServerCLI.exe - Command-line interface for the server.
       ServerGUI.exe - Graphical interface for the server.
       HeartbeatSaver.exe - A console heartbeat sender, for use when the server is down



=== Command-line Options ======================================================

In addition to many settings stored in config.xml, 800Craft has several special
options that can only be set via command-line switches:

    --path=<path>       Working path (directory) that 800Craft should use. If the
                        given path is relative, it's computed against the
                        location of fCraft.dll

    --logpath=<path>    Path (directory) where the log files should be placed.
                        If the given path is relative, it's computed against the
                        working path.

    --mappath=<path>    Path (directory) where the map files should be loaded
                        from/saved to.  If the given path is relative, it's
                        computed against the working path.

    --config=<file>     Path (file) of the configuration file, including the
                        filename (typically "config.xml"). If the given path
                        is relative, it's computed against the working path.

    --norestart         If this flag is present, 800Craft will shutdown whenever
                        it would normally restart (e.g. automatic updates or
                        /restart command). This may be useful if you are using
                        an auto-restart script or a process monitor.

    --exitoncrash       If this flag is present, 800Craft frontends will exit
                        at once in the event of an unrecoverable crash, instead
                        of showing a message and prompting for user input.

    --nolog             If this flag is present, all logging is disabled.

    --nocolor           If this flag is present, ServerCLI will not use any
                        colors or formatting in its console output.



=== Help & Support ============================================================

When you first join the server, promote yourself by typing...
    /rank YourNameHere owner
...in the server's console. Replace "owner" if you renamed your highest rank.

Type "/help" in-game or in server console to get started. Type "/commands" for
a list of available commands.
