## About 800Craft 
800Craft is a custom server developed by Jonty800 and GlennMR. 800Craft is forked from fCraft, it is designed to maintain high performance without lag or crashing while having a wide selection of implemented commands and features. 

## History

800Craft started off as Au70 v800.X, which was a private mod of fCraft built specifically for Au70 Galaxy by Jonty800. The software was placed in Sourceforge as a backup, but somehow went viral and suddenly there was a demand for new features from hosts who had found the software and were using it full-time. In October 2011, a Halloween Mod was released and was recommended to Project-Vanilla host 'GlennMR'. Glenn contacted Jonty800 personally and persuaded him to make an Official Software with him. The software then changed name to '800Craft' (the name of the sourceforge) and branch 0.1x was released in late December.


## Installation (Windows)

80Craft requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0. Your system may already have it
installed, and you can download it from microsoft.com

## Installation (Linux, Unix, MacOS X)

800Craft requires Mono 2.10 (recommended). You can
download it from www.mono-project.org, or (on some Linux distributions) install
it through your package manager.

To be able to use graphical 800Craft components (ServerGUI and ConfigGUI) you
will also need GDI+ library (libgdiplus). Before starting 800Craft, make sure
that it has read/write permissions in the 800Craft directory.

To run ".exe" files with Mono, use the following syntax:
Mono 2.6.4: "mono SomeFile.exe"
Mono 2.8+:  "mono --gc=sgen SomeFile.exe"
