## About 800Craft 
800Craft is a custom server developed by Jonty800 and GlennMR, and then taken over by MrBluePotato and LeChosenOne after Jonty800 and GlennMR retired from developing. It then became known as 800craft Plus. 800Craft Plus is forked from fCraft, it is designed to maintain high performance without lag or crashing while having a wide selection of implemented commands and features. 

## Installation (Windows)

800Craft Plus requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0. Your system may already have it
installed, and you can download it from microsoft.com

## Installation (Linux, Unix, MacOS X)

800Craft Plus requires Mono 2.10 (recommended). You can
download it from www.mono-project.org, or (on some Linux distributions) install
it through your package manager.

To be able to use graphical 800Craft Plus components (ServerGUI and ConfigGUI) you
will also need GDI+ library (libgdiplus). Before starting 800Craft Plus, make sure
that it has read/write permissions in the 800Craft Plus directory.

To run ".exe" files with Mono, use the following syntax:
Mono 2.6.4: "mono SomeFile.exe"
Mono 2.8+:  "mono --gc=sgen SomeFile.exe"

If you're intending to run a public server that appears on minecraft.net's server list, you need to import https certificates to tell mono you trust them, this can be done by running mozroots --import --ask-remove as the 800Craft Plus user on your system.
